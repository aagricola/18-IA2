## Installations

### COURSE DESCRIPTION

Students will learn and apply various media, methods, concepts and technologies to create interactive, site-specific, and/or responsive installations. Students will investigate the way we relate to objects, people and spaces through the creation of dynamic, site-conditioned projects. Sound, electronics, participation, games, play and beyond will be used for the creation of participatory, installation events. Students will work both individually and collaboratively throughout the semester. Studio work and techniques will be supplemented by readings, lectures and discussions on current and historical perspectives on interactive and responsive installation art.

 ## Important Things to Remember
 - Help is always a click away; via the internet, your peers, or emailing me. Remember to do homework ahead of time so that you can get questions to me 48 hours before class.
 - Mistakes are great ways to learn. Be courageous, fail flamboyantly, and know that you tried your best. Don't let fear or mistakes stand in your way of learning and creating.
 - Participation and collaboration are integral parts of this class's culture. This also means you come prepared to all of the classes, do the homework, and be engaged.
 -  Share what you learn along the way and collaborate with your peers. We are embodying an open source education model.
 - You get one unexcused absence, the next diminishes your grade and the third gets an F. Please provide me with a doctors note if you are sick. Talk to me if you have an extended leave of absence.
