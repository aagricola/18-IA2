Explores human emotion through real-time face tracking.
"Aimed to decode the relationship between prototypical intern emotional states... and facial expression by charting the neural pathways that trigger the muscles."
"Emotion is offloaded" - Schwartzman

## Workshop Prompt: Expanded Self
For homework last week, you read the short essays from Madeline Schwartzman's latest exhibition catalogue "See Yourself X". Think about the ideas she presents of extensions of the self. Consider how the computer is utilized as a tool to map and analyze the human body, face, activity, ect. Using face tracking or FaceOSC, make something that analyzes or extends the digital body beyond the possibilities of the physical body. Imagine a future. How might the body change, be used as interface, as marketing, as canvas -- try to think beyond the known.
"The face is a blank slate for real time projected fantasy" -Madeline Schwartzman

## Homework

- Finish "Expanded Self"

## Resources

[Golan Levin FaceOSC Processing Example](https://github.com/CreativeInquiry/FaceOSC-Templates/tree/master/processing)  "FaceOSCReceiver" is the example we did together in class

[Github for OpenCV library](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing)

[Documentation of OpenCV Haar Cascade](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.1/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html)

[Adam HArvey, CV Face detection Cascade visualized](https://vimeo.com/12774628),
"This video visualizes the detection process of OpenCV's face detector. The algorithm uses the Viola Jones method of calculating the integral image and then performing some calculations on all the areas defined by the black and white rectangles to analyze the differences between the dark and light regions of a face."

[Documentation of an ITP workshop on face recognition and face tracking taught by Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman/Face-It) - great processing examples and tutorials here

# Next Week:
- look at what you made for Expanded Self Workshop
- Toxic Tour with Glenn Ross 10am - 12pm
- Course Evaluations
- Turn in any outstanding Documentation or homework to canvas
